# Revenue Forecasting with Least Squares and Seasonality

This project demonstrates how to forecast revenue using the **Least Squares** method combined with **seasonality** adjustments. The toolset used includes **Python** libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-Learn**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future revenue based on historical data by leveraging a simple yet effective forecasting technique. The model incorporates seasonality to account for recurring patterns in the data.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (graphs and plots).
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models.

## 📈 How it Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared, with missing values handled and time series data formatted appropriately.
2. **Seasonality Adjustment**: A seasonal component is extracted and modeled to adjust for cyclical trends.
3. **Least Squares Method**: The revenue forecast is generated using the least squares method, which minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
4. **Visualization**: The model’s performance is visualized with plots to compare actual vs. predicted revenue over time.

## 📊 Example Output

The following is a sample of the project’s output:

- Forecasted revenue values for future months
- A comparison chart of actual vs. predicted revenue

## 🔍 Results

The model accurately forecasts revenue, accounting for seasonal patterns, with an improvement over simpler models that don’t include seasonality.
